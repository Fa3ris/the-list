# Project Overview

This project is a static web using vitepress to list subjects or things I did or that I want to do. The subjects can be categorized and there is a detail article for each of them. The goal is to avoid writing the page by hand as much as possible but to rely on templates that get injected with data.

## Folder Structure

- `./docs`: vitepress expects the markdown files and assets like images to be placed here to generate the site.
- `./scripts`: contains source files to automate the generation of vitepress markdown files.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- vitepress
- puppeteer

## Coding Standards

- use ES module syntax
- favor immutability
